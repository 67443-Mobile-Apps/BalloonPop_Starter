Balloon Pop Starter Code
---

This is the starter code for the in-class exercise for the Balloon Pop game.  The code is mostly complete, but there are two things we still have to do.  First, we have to handle the touches -- critically important to this game.  Second, we have to define what will happen when a balloon is popped.

The two methods that need to be completed have instructions in the comments right before them, as well as comments within the method itself to guide you.  Try to rely on this guidance and not a generative AI to complete the exercise.
